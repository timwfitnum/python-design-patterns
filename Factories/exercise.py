    Factory Coding Exercise
    You are given a class called Person . 
    The person has two attributes: id , and name .
    Please implement a  PersonFactory that has a non-static
    create_person()  method that takes a person's name and
    return a person initialized with this name and an id.
    The id of the person should be set as a 0-based index
    of the object created. So, the first person the factory
    makes should have Id=0, second Id=1 and so on.
